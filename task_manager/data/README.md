# Database Directory

This directory contains the application database files. The files themselves are not tracked by Git, but the directory structure is maintained.

## Database Files
- `task-manager-db.mv.db` - H2 database file
- `task-manager-db.trace.db` - H2 trace file (created when database is running)

These database files are automatically created when the application runs for the first time.
